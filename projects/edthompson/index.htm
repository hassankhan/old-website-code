		       	<h1>Occupy London</h1>
	        	<p>On the 15th of October 2011 a number of people from diverse backgrounds came together to dispute the culture of greed that exists in the current financial system. The protestors planned to 'Occupy' the London Stock Exchange (LSE), however they fell short of that goal and ended up occupying the space outside it, on the edge of land between the LSE and St Pauls Cathedral. They are part of a global movement that 'Occupied' over a 1000 cities worldwide at one point, most famously, Occupy Wall Street.</p>
<br />
<p>What made Occupy London powerful and different was that it was highly organised and peaceful. On the grounds around St Pauls Cathedral they constructed a camp which had a working kitchen, a library, a university and a cinema. They discussed decisions in working groups of 8-12 people and then brought up ideas at the larger general assemblies that took place each night; a form of direct democracy. They occupied various other spaces and buildings around London including a derelict Magistrates Court and a derelict UBS building.</p>
<br />
<p>An edit of the series went viral online in November 2011 as a multimedia piece. With the help of OccupyLSX, Occupy Wall St., Anonymous and a host of photography critics/editors/bloggers, it was shared to over 500,000 people in a week.</p>
