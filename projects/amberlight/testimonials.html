        <q>The counsellor formed a good working relationship with the schools co-ordinator for the project. When she met with parents she was sensitive and reassuring in that role. She always referred all matters to the co-ordinator and to me. She was most professional in her approach.</q>

        <q>The counsellor has introduced basic counselling skills to members of our staff, which has enabled them to feel comfortable when addressing issues brought up by parents, staff or children. The counsellor has inspired me to develop my knowledge of counselling further and I am at present studying a basic counselling course.</q>

        <q>Having suffered with depression to varying degrees for many years, I had resigned myself to the fact that it was just something I would have to learn to live with. The Amberlight taught me that this was not necessarily the case. Over a period of months, my counsellor led me through the most painful and difficult period of my life, including the breakup of my marriage, the death of both parents to whom I was very close, and the subsequent birth of my son. She showed me the tools and skills that I needed to get me through these experiences, and indeed to live my life to the full, without allowing every obstacle or set-back to become an insurmountable problem. I truly believe that without her support and guidance I would not be the person I am today. My life has turned around, and I am now moving forward positively, and looking forward to the future, something I never thought I would be able to say.</q>

        <q>I never realised how much emotional baggage I was carrying around with me. Even though I am entering my sixties, I feel free and young at heart. No words will ever express what I now feel however the smile on my face says it all.</q>
