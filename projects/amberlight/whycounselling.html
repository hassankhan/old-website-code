   <article>
        <p>There are many misconceptions as to what counselling really is. No matter how independent we are, there are occasions in our lives when we need help to sort out a problem or to come through a time of crisis. This is not to say that a counsellor will sort out your problems for you, instead they will help you find answers that are acceptable to you and are unique to you within your own world. You are the expert and sometimes need to be reminded of that.</p><br />
	<p>Our family and friends are often our first port of call when we need someone to talk to and often our needs are met by our loved ones. There are times when we don't want to burden the people we care about and stop ourselves from being totally honest in fear that it will be too much for them to bear and so we suffer in silence.</p><br />
	<p>You may be concerned about personal, family or relationship issues, maybe difficulties at work or financial matters might be making you feel tense and/or low. You may have experienced bereavement or some other kind of loss. Any form of sadness that takes a grip of us and prevents us from functioning at a level where we are comfortable can be helped through counselling.</p><br />
