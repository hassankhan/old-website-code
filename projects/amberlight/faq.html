        <h2>What is counselling?</h2>
	<p>Counselling is about exploring any worries, anxieties, problems or feelings that you feel are interfering in your personal, academic or working life. These issues may be in the here and now or in the past. It is a chance for you to be listened to, for your worries to be taken seriously, and to be supported in reaching you own decisions and conclusions.</p><br />
	<h2>I don't see how therapy is going to work!</h2>
	<p>You may feel this because you feel somewhat helpless about your situation, if this is the case, tell the therapist. Asking how the therapy can work for you is a good question to ask.</p><br />
	<h2>How will talking get anything done?</h2>
	<p>It isn't so much about talking as listening. We are all guilty, to a greater or lesser degree, of not listening to our true needs. We may suppress them out of fear, out of a sense of duty, or in an attempt to gain the acceptance of others - especially if we have low self-esteem. Our aim is to help you get in touch with these needs and talking in a safe non-judgmental way offers the opportunity to address and free ourselves from self-doubt.</p><br />
	<h2>How long will it take?</h2>
	<p>This depends on so many things that it's really hard to say. A few people come for 6-8 sessions whilst others feel they need 20-30 and occasionally some decide to continue for longer. One reason for this relates to the client wanting to address other issues and set new goals and objectives for themselves.</p>
	<p>The presenting issue (the reason why a client wanted counselling) and goals set stay as the focal point for counselling. Amberlight offers 6-8 week reviews to enable both the client and counsellor to evaluate what has been achieved to date within the sessions, offering the opportunity for the client to re-evaluate their own needs, readdress their goals and objectives and and discuss whether or not the client wishes to continue with the counselling.</p><br />
	<br />
	<p>Remember you the client and you alone are the expert on what you need.</p><br />
